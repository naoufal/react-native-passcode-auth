React Native Passcode Auth is a [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) library for authenticating users with iOS Passcode.  It is an excellent fallback for when [Touch ID](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-touch-id) is not available.

## Install
React Native Passcode Auth __requires iOS 9.0 or later__.

```shell
npm i --save react-native-passcode-auth
```

## Usage
### Linking the Library
In order to use Passcode Auth, you must first link the library to your project.  There's excellent documentation on how to do this in the [React Native Docs](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html#content).

### Requesting Passcode Authentication
Once you've linked the library, you'll want to make it available to your app by requiring it:

```js
import PasscodeAuth from 'react-native-passcode-auth';
```

Requesting Passcode authentication is as simple as calling:
```js
PasscodeAuth.authenticate('to demo this react-native component')
  .then(success => {
    // Success code
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Failure code
  });
```

## Example
Using PasscodeAuth in your app will usually look like this:
```js
import React, { Component, AlertIOS, TouchableHighlight, View, Text } from 'react-native';
import PasscodeAuth from 'react-native-passcode-auth';

class YourComponent extends Component {
  _pressHandler() {
    PasscodeAuth.authenticate('to demo this react-native component')
      .then(success => {
        AlertIOS.alert('Authenticated Successfully');
      })
      .catch(error => {
        AlertIOS.alert('Authentication Failed');
      });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        ...
        <TouchableHighlight onPress={this._pressHandler}>
          <Text>
            Authenticate with Passcode
          </Text>
        </TouchableHighlight>
      </View>
    );
  }
});
```

## Methods
### authenticate(reason)
Attempts to authenticate with Passcode.
Returns a `Promise` object.

__Arguments__
- `reason` - An _optional_ `String` that provides a clear reason for requesting authentication.

__Examples__
```js
PasscodeAuth.authenticate('to demo this react-native component')
  .then(success => {
    // Success code
    console.log('User authenticated with Passcode');
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Failure code
    console.log(error);
  });
```

### isSupported()
Verify's that Passcode Auth is supported and that Passcode is set.
Returns a `Promise` object.

__Examples__
```js
PasscodeAuth.isSupported()
  .then(supported => {
    // Success code
    console.log('Passcode Auth is supported.');
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Failure code
    console.log(error);
  });
```

## Errors
There are various reasons why authenticating with Passcode may fail.  Whenever calling Passcode authentication fails, `PasscodeAuth.authenticate` will return an error code representing the reason.

Below is a list of error codes that can be returned:

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| `LAErrorAuthenticationFailed` | Authentication was not successful because the user failed to provide valid credentials. |
| `LAErrorUserCancel` | Authentication was canceled by the user—for example, the user tapped Cancel in the dialog. |
| `LAErrorUserFallback` | Authentication was canceled because the user tapped the fallback button (Enter Password). |
| `LAErrorSystemCancel` | Authentication was canceled by system—for example, if another application came to foreground while the authentication dialog was up. |
| `LAErrorPasscodeNotSet` | Authentication could not start because the passcode is not set on the device. |
| `PasscodeAuthNotSet` | Authentication could not start because the passcode is not set on the device. |
| `PasscodeAuthNotSupported` | Device does not support Passcode Auth. |

_More information on errors can be found in [Apple's Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/LocalAuthentication/Reference/LAContext_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/c/tdef/LAError)._
